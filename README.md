<h3 align="center"> SaveNet </h3>

A deep neural network modeling framework to make early predictions of onset of floods due to increase in water levels in rivers, oceans, and other water bodies. The model takes into account all the available predictive potentials within a region to make the best prediction of increase in water level in water bodies. Such predictive potentials for a coastal area are the harmonic tide and the past water levels recorded by one or multiple meteorological stations. For some areas where operational forecasting of physical ocean models exist, the model results will also be taken as predictive features for training the model. Non-water level types of data - rainfall,wind, air pressure, temperature, and salinity are also explored due to their effects on the onset of floods.
